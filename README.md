# FRC 9012 Team Waffle using MAXSwerve

See [the online changelog](https://github.com/REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-Template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for information about updates to the template that may have been released since you created your project.


## MaxSwerve Prerequisites

* SPARK MAX Firmware v26.1.0
* REVLib v2026.0.0

## MaxSwerve Configuration

It is possible that this project will not work for your robot right out of the box. Various things like the CAN IDs, PIDF gains, chassis configuration, etc. must be determined for your own robot!

These values can be adjusted in the `Configs.java` and `Constants.java` files.
